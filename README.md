<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="images/Screenshot.PNG" alt="Logo">

In a landscape of healthcare and rehabilitation apps, TheraPose.ai emerges as a game-changer. Designed specifically for individuals undergoing physical therapy, TheraPose.ai utilizes cutting-edge computer vision technology to provide invaluable support during their recovery journey.

Here's why TheraPose.ai is a standout solution:

* Personalized rehabilitation: TheraPose.ai empowers patients to take control of their rehabilitation process by offering real-time feedback on their exercise performance. By accurately assessing their movements, the app ensures that patients are executing prescribed exercises correctly, minimizing the risk of further injury and maximizing therapeutic benefits.
* Streamlined guidance: Say goodbye to uncertainty and guesswork. TheraPose.ai streamlines the rehabilitation process by offering clear, visual cues and corrections, guiding patients through each exercise with precision and clarity.
* Empowering patients: With TheraPose.ai, patients can track their progress over time, witnessing tangible improvements in their mobility and strength. This visual representation of progress serves as a powerful motivator, encouraging patients to stay dedicated to their therapy regimen.
While TheraPose.ai may not cater to every individual's specific therapy needs, it serves as a comprehensive and reliable tool for patients seeking to optimize their rehabilitation experience. We're committed to continually enhancing the app's features and functionalities and welcome contributions and feedback from the community. Together, we can make TheraPose.ai the ultimate companion for patients on their path to recovery.

Age: 45
Health Status: Undergoing physical therapy treatment following a traffic accident.
Location: Hanoi, Vietnam

He requires an app to remotely submit physical therapy exercises, through which he can receive feedback and guidance from healthcare professionals conveniently and effectively.

He prefers an interface that is user-friendly and visually intuitive, helping him easily perform physical therapy exercises and submit results to healthcare professionals.
#### Challenges and Issues:
Anh Tuan struggles to perform physical therapy exercises correctly and adequately each day.
